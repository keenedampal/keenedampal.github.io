            <h2>BLACK?!</h2> 
            <p>Yes! I looooove the color black! There's just something about it that makes me happy whenever I see it. It's very aesthetically pleasing and it goes with literally anything! I personally like black as an accessory color on most of my things and I don't seem to get over it. I don't even have any plans getting over black!</p>

            <h2>The psychology behind black.</h2>
            <p>Black is no doubt a very popular color due to its versitality among colors. According to Nicole Martins Ferreira (2019), black’s color meaning is symbolic of mystery, power, elegance, and sophistication. In contrast, the color meaning can also evoke emotions such as sadness and anger. Black is also a popular color for text as it’s an easy color to read.</p>
