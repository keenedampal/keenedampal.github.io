            <h2>Introduction</h2> 
            <p>Hi! My name is Keene Yael A. Dampal and I'm from Grade 9-Sodium. This webpage, along with the following pages, will be about 3 of my favorite colors and why I like them. These will also include cool facts about color such as why we have favorite colors and how it affects our daily lives!</p>

            <h2>What are colors?</h2>
            <p>According to the Merriam-Webster Dictionary, a color is a phenomenon of light (such as red, brown, pink, or gray) or visual perception that enables one to differentiate objects. Scientifically speaking, different objects have different colors because each of them have their own way of reflecting light. An object's color is technically the color of the light that they are reflecting. Did you know that the more light an object reflects, the less heat it gathers? With this information, we can say that lighter objects tend to reflect heat while darker objects tend to absorb heat. Wow!</p>

            <h2>Why do we have favorite colors?</h2>
            <p>According to R. Douglas Fields, Ph.D., a neuroscientist and author, color preferences are deeply rooted emotional responses that seem to lack any sensible basis. Although the reasons for having a favorite color isn't from a rational basis, having a color preference greatly influences our everyday choices in life from the food we eat to the clothes we wear. For example, you wouldn't eat a pizza with green spots because the presence of the color green could indicate that the pizza might be molding. Ew! Having a preference of color on certain objects might save us from an unwanted bellyache but in most cases, it really doesn't affect our lives that much. We are basically ruled by the unconcious and mysterious power of color just because they make us feel things that we enjoy!</p>
